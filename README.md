## Overview

ReanimateMC is a revolutionary Minecraft plugin that transforms the conventional death system by introducing a **KO (Knockout) state**. Instead of players dying instantly when their health reaches zero, they enter an intermediary knockout state where they can be revived by teammates or executed by enemies.

This innovative mechanic creates dynamic gameplay opportunities perfect for:
- **Hardcore Survival servers** - Adding tension and teamwork
- **Role-play servers** - Creating dramatic rescue scenarios  
- **PvP servers** - Strategic decisions between mercy and execution
- **Adventure maps** - Enhanced cooperative gameplay

## Gameplay Mechanics

### The KO System

When a player's health reaches zero:

1. **KO Trigger**: Player enters knockout state instead of dying
2. **Visual Effects**: Player lies down, optional particles and blindness
3. **Movement**: Immobilized or limited crawling based on configuration
4. **Timer**: Countdown begins (configurable duration)
5. **Options**: Can be revived, executed, or will die when timer expires

### Revival Process

**Requirements:**
- Another player must crouch near the KO'd player
- Reviver must hold the required item (default: Golden Apple)
- Revival takes time (configurable, default 5 seconds)
- Both players must remain still during revival

**Revival Effects:**
- KO'd player regains health
- Temporary effects applied (nausea, slowness, resistance)
- Cooldown applied to prevent spam

### Execution System

**Process:**
- Any player can execute a KO'd player
- Hold left-click for configured duration (default 2 seconds)
- Optional broadcast message announces executions
- Results in permanent death

### Distress Signal System

**Activation:**
- KO'd players press F (swap hands key)
- Creates a beacon at their location
- Broadcasts coordinates to nearby players
- One-time use per KO

### Offline KO Management

**When KO'd players disconnect:**
- KO state is saved to file
- Timer continues counting down
- Player dies if timer expires before reconnection
- State restored when player reconnects

### Crawling Mechanics

**Two Movement States:**
1. **Immobilized**: Complete movement restriction
2. **Crawling**: Slow movement with heavy slowness effect

**Controls:**
- Use `/reanimatemc crawl` to toggle states
- Configurable auto-crawl option
- Separate permission for crawling ability

## API for Developers

ReanimateMC provides a comprehensive API for other plugins to integrate with the KO system.

### Events

#### PlayerKOEvent
Fired when a player enters KO state.

```java
@EventHandler
public void onPlayerKO(PlayerKOEvent event) {
    Player player = event.getPlayer();
    int duration = event.getDuration();
    
    // Cancel the KO event
    event.setCancelled(true);
    
    // Custom logic here
}
```

#### PlayerReanimatedEvent
Fired when a player is revived from KO state.

```java
@EventHandler
public void onPlayerRevived(PlayerReanimatedEvent event) {
    Player player = event.getPlayer();
    Player reanimator = event.getReanimator();
    boolean successful = event.isSuccessful();
    long timestamp = event.getTimestamp();
    
    // Custom logic here
}
```

### API Access

Get the KOManager instance:

```java
// Get the plugin instance
ReanimateMC plugin = (ReanimateMC) Bukkit.getPluginManager().getPlugin("ReanimateMC");

// Access the KO manager
KOManager koManager = plugin.getKoManager();

// Check if player is KO'd
boolean isKO = koManager.isKO(player);

// Force KO a player
koManager.setKO(player, 30); // 30 seconds

// Revive a player
koManager.revive(player, reviverPlayer);

// Execute a player
koManager.execute(player);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Players die instantly instead of entering KO
**Solutions:**
- Check that `knockout.enabled: true` in config.yml
- Verify players don't have `reanimatemc.bypass` permission
- Ensure no conflicting death plugins are installed

#### Revival not working
**Solutions:**
- Check reviver has `reanimatemc.revive` permission
- Verify reviver is crouching and holding correct item
- Check revival cooldowns haven't been triggered
- Ensure `reanimation.require_special_item` setting matches usage

#### GUI configuration not opening
**Solutions:**
- Verify player has `reanimatemc.admin` permission
- Check console for errors during plugin load
- Try `/reanimatemc reload` and retry

#### Language files not loading
**Solutions:**
- Check language code is correct in config.yml
- Verify language file exists in `plugins/ReanimateMC/lang/`
- Use `/reanimatemc reload` after changes

### Debug Information

Enable debug logging by setting your server's logging level to DEBUG for more detailed error information.

### Getting Help

1. **Check the console** for error messages
2. **Verify configuration** using the GUI or config files
